## Requirements

The requirements in the [top-level README](../README.md) still apply. In
addition, ensure you have installed Gradle, and that it is (at the time of this
writing) at least version 3.3 or newer.

## Getting Started

You can run this test project from both the command line as well as from
<<<<<<< HEAD
Android Studio:

Android Studio.
>>>>>>> 1cc6ddc45c2c9dd4b7aacff4a5055552189e0d25

### Command Line

Ensure you have the gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`, in this directory. If
you do not, you can run the following to generate it:

    $ cd cordova-android/test
    $ gradle :wrapper -b build.gradle

You can then see a list of all tasks available to run with `gradlew tasks`.

The two different kinds of tests one typically wants to run are unit tests and
end-to-end, or instrumented, tests. Unit tests do not require any particular
environment to run in, but the instrumented tests, however, require a connected
Android device or emulator to run in.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- To run the unit tests, run: `gradlew test`.
- To run the instrumented tests, run: `gradlew connectedAndroidTest`.

To make sure all tests are run, add the `--rerun-tasks` parameter.
=======
To run the unit tests, run: `gradlew test`.
To run the instrumented tests, run: `gradlew connectedAndroidTest`.
